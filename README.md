# gps-average-path

This repository contains code capable of returning an average path from several raw nmea files. The input files can have different sampling frequencies.

The work was developed by João Louro and Samuel Cardoso as a project for the Navigation Systems course at Instituto Superior Técnico.

More detailed documentation (in portuguese) can be found in documentation.pdf.
